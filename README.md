## Description
Real-time data is being downloaded from [my server](https://weather.fkor.us/api.php).
Measurements are made on my Arduino weather station and sent to server every (about) 5 seconds.
Every hour temperature is being stored in the MySQL database. Graph from selected day is being generated from data read from DB.
